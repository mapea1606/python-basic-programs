# python-basic-programs

Hello and welcome! This repository is a place for my practice programs and scripts in **Python**. You'll find simple solutions and examples here that I've developed as part of my learning journey to master the language's basic features.

## A Note on Organization

This is a personal learning space, not a polished portfolio. The scripts here are not neatly categorized or organizedâ€”they are the direct result of my daily practice. My goal is to keep writing code and learning, and sometimes that means things get a little messy!

## What to Expect

Each script is a small experiment or solution focused on a specific Python concept, such as:

* **Data Structures:** lists, dictionaries, tuples.
* **Loops:** `for` and `while` statements.
* **Conditionals:** `if`, `elif`, `else`.
* **Functions:** basic definition and use.

### Thanks for Stopping By!

Feel free to look around. I hope these small examples can be helpful or at least a good illustration for others who, like me, are learning Python.
